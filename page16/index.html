<p>Come to a hands-on open hardware/open source Arduino microcontroller introduction given by the staff of First Year Engineering (FYE) program with an emphasis on their new lab centered about the “Advance Energy Vehicle (AEV),” controlled, of course, by an Arduino.  FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.  A Matlab/Arduino interface created by Dr. Campa at Mathworks will be displayed, including a “real-time” data graphing example along with simple servo and motor control.  Some other Arduino related tools, such as the fritzing.org software, will also be displayed and discussed.  A pitch will be given for ideas, and possibly programming help, in simplifying the AEV code as much as possible for students with Matlab, but no C++, background.</p>

This Thursday, May 19 at 7PM in Dreese 264, Alex Burkhart will describe the basic concept of functional programming and introduce us to Haskell. Next, Silas Baronda will present Erlang.</p>

The emphasis will be on Free, Open Source games, but people are welcome to play whatever they’d like. Additional details can be found at the <a href="/lan">LAN website</a> as well as a registration form, to help us get a feel for how many people we will have and what games you want to play. Please bring your computer, any game media you might need, as well as a network cable or two, in case some people do not have one. If you have any questions, please send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

If you are interested in running, please email elections@opensource.osu.edu in order to be listed here and in the meeting announcement. Any OSU student who has been to at least one meeting is eligible to run for president, vice president, or treasurer.</p>

<p>The following people have announced their candidacy.</p>

<p>President: Daniel Thau
Vice President: Paul Schwendenman, Brian Swaney (tentative)
Treasurer: Joel Friedly</p>

<p>In addition, Brian Swaney has proposed the following ballot initiative.</p>

<p>With most discussion surrounding ACTA/COCIA/SHIELD and Wikileaks ex post facto legislation died down, the immediate urgency with which it was hastily voted on and posted is alleviated. The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal. While the Open Source Club will continue its endorsement of EFF, it no longer seems necessary to keep extra clutter on our web page. <em>Shall the Ohio State University Open Source Club remove the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Say NO to online censorship” button?</em></p>

MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

These utilities can be useful in their own right, but often can be connected together with pipes to do new and interesting things. It would be helpful if people interested in presenting signed up with their choices, either by emailing me at meinwald.1@osu.edu or commenting below. This way we can avoid duplication. For now assume each talk can be up to 5 minutes, but that is subject to change.</p>

<p>So far the following people have signed up.</p>

<p>Dan Thau: awk, clive, busybox, graft, pwd, whoami
Morgan Goose: netcat, tar, rsync, iperf, tee
Matt Meinwald: curl, wget
Alek Rollyson: tshark, offlineimap, slock, packer, gnupg, rtorrent</p>

On Wednesday, April 20, at 6:30 PM in Lazenby 021, teams of students and faculty will be competing to answer computer science-related questions, perhaps with a few other topics occasionally mixed in. This time, people will be choosing their own teams. You can sign up your team in the CSE advising office on the third floor of Dreese.</p>

If you can answer yes to any of these and would like to know what else to avoid, or if you can’t and would like to keep it that way, please join us as various club members present how to break things! Everyone who has a story or a deadly command, please come and share it with us, no prior approval needed. Everyone else, prepare to be entertained.</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting on Thursday at 7PM in Dreese 264.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI’s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>

This talk is meant as a general overview of tools available as well as their practical applications in security audits and penetration testing. Tools and topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wireshark (protocol analyzer)</li>
  <li>Metasploit (penetration testing suite)</li>
  <li>Ettercap (multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN)</li>
  <li>Aircrack-ng (set of tools for testing wireless security)</li>
  <li>OpenVAS (open source replacement for Nessus, a vulnerability scanner)</li>
  <li>Nmap (swiss army port scanner)</li>
  <li>Password Crackers (John the Ripper, Ophcrack)</li>
  <li>Distros such as Backtrack, Knoppix STD, Damn Vulnerable Linux</li>
  <li>Kippo (simple honeypot with recording capabilities)</li>
  <li>A few hardening techniques and tools (mandatory access control, port knocking, intrusion detection tools, common sense things, old wive’s tales)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This talk is meant for educational purposes only. Techniques demonstrated should only be used on your own systems as using any of these techniques on systems that you do not own has a high probability of you ending up behind bars. These tools will be presented from the perspective of a security auditor and/or a systems administrator wishing to find weak spots in his or her own defenses.
