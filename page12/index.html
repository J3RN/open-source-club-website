Paul Schwendenman, this year’s president, will be giving an introduction to what it means for something to be Open Source- hopefully helping to explain to any potential new members what the club is really about.</p>

<p>As always, pizza will be provided.</p>

It allows for profiling or otherwise analyzing a running system, both at the kernel and userspace levels. I will start my talk by reviewing some of the other profiling and debugging tools available on a Linux system, then will illustrate how SystemTap can do all of that and a whole lot more.</p>

The older channel is currently setup to forward people over to the newer channel. This was done for several reasons, a few of which are to make our channel name match up with the cloaks we provide (<a href="https://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml">more about how freenode operates</a>), and simplify the channel name. A few new things you may notice, besides the name, are that everyone is +v (voiced) upon joining the channel and a few new modes set. The voice is <a href="http://swhack.com/logs/2011-03-08#T18-50-27">a work around</a> for those who the IRCd may consider typing too fast or pasting anything more than a few lines. Also those with the @osuosc/* cloaks are +e and +I’ed on the room. The +e means that those with the cloaks are exempt from any bans or quiets, and the +I means that those with the cloaks can join if the room becomes +i for any reason in the future (even if temporarily). The ACL (Access Control List) remains the same from the previous room, /msg ChanServ access #osuosc list. For an explanation of all the channel modes set at any give time you can pull up help in two places: <strong>/quote help cmode</strong> or <a href="https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml">freenode’s guide to “Using the network”</a>. (Note the /quote command also works for user modes too, <strong>/quote help umode</strong>.) Also at this time the channel #osuosc-ops was created for those who have privileges on #osuosc to handle any type of dispute that may arise in the future from a ban. This channel will primarily be for handling any type of disputes that may arise from a ban or any other channel management. This channel is logged for internal use of the ops. The rules for the channel remain the same as previously set and remember the channel is still logged.</p>

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently.  For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>
</div></li></ul>    <ul><li><h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/05/11/elections-latex-and-lan-party/">Elections, LaTeX, and LAN party</a></h2>           <span class="date">posted: 05-11-2012</span><div class="content"><p>Elections for the OSU Open Source Club officer positions are currently planned for May 17th, 2012. They will take place in the normal meeting room (Dreese 369) and at the normal time (7:00PM EDT). If the date does not work for you and you are a voting club member (ie, you are a student and have attended at least one meeting prior to the vote), please contact the club offers as soon as possible and we will see what we can do. Three positions need to be filled. More details about the responsibilities of each member can be found in the <a href="/constitution">club constitution</a> on our web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>President: Primary responsibility is to ensure a meeting place and topic is set.</li>
  <li>Vice President: Keep the minutes and fill in for the President when he or she is unavailable.</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Manage club funds (and order pizza)</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically the club has had other positions (which are not officially recognized by the university):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Webmaster: manages the club website.</li>
  <li>E-council representative: Attends e-council meetings. Usually appointed by the Treasurer.</li>
</ul>

<p>As is evident from the tone of our club constitution, the club’s original founders seemed to intend for it to be reasonable laid back; none of these positions should be overly stressful. Worst case scenario is the club website has some downtime, the club misses some free pizza, we have to fumble to find a new room, and have to wing a conversation rather than having a pre-set presentation. In addition to the election, Daniel “paradigm” Thau will present the LaTeX markup language. LaTeX is a markup language used by many Mathematicians, Scientists, and Engineers which is particularly capable at typesetting Mathematics. Finally, a reminder: Mothers day is Sunday, May 13th. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas for what to get her, maybe the Open Source Club LAN party the day before on Saturday, May 12th which runs from 2:00PM to 11:30PM (ie, 9.5 hours) at the Ohio Union Interfaith Prayer and Reflection room would be a good place to find something. Maybe. Okay, probably not.</p>

This presentation will cover many of the basics and bring people up to speed of creating applications in the language. The crash course into Python’s basics will be “follow along” and questions are encouraged. The later half of the presentation will be presenting clever and nifty ways to accomplish various tasks that can be done in Python that are easier than building in other languages. A tour of the standard library is expected along with a tour of some open source Python projects that can be implemented into anything you may want to create.</p>

<p>The meeting will be in Dreese Labs 369 this Thursday, May 10, at 7:00pm, 2012-05-10T1900-0400.</p>
