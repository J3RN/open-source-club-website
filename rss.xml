<content type="html" xml:base="opensource.osu.edu/open-source-club-website/announcements/2015/10/30/license-to-code/">&lt;p&gt;Come join us Thursday, the fifth of November, as Brandon Moore talks about licenses and why you should use one on any project you work on. Licensing is a key part of the open source community, and your choices are diverse. We will talk about licenses ranging from the copyleft to the copyright, the unlicense to the Apache license. We will discuss how you choose your license for a project and what implications your choice has, and more importantly what a lack of choosing a license means and how it affects the Open Source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every week, laptops are encouraged and there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moore3071/license_presentation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:base="opensource.osu.edu/open-source-club-website/announcements/2015/10/27/wireless-security-and-penetration-testing/">&lt;p&gt;This Thursday, October 29th at 7PM in Caldwell 120, I, Eli Gladman, will speak on wireless security and penetration testing. Specifically I will be going over common network vulnerabilities and misconceptions. After a brief introduction, I will demonstrate how to brute force particular types of WiFi access points due to their inherently insecure “encryption”. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of this talk is to educate members with respect to securing their own local networks. We are by no means responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. Performing said activities without the explicit permission of said owner is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

presenting on GPG, the GNU implantation of the PGP standard. PGP is a tool that
allows people to communicate with each other securely, even if they’ve never met
in person. We’ll talk about the Web of Trust concept, and how you can help
expand it via key signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, we’ll have a “key signing party”. If you’ve never heard of
this: don’t worry, we’ll talk about it during the presentation. But if you want
to participate, bring some for of photo ID with you to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptops are encouraged (this is a highly interactive presentation for newcomers)
but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

We will then walk over to the Convention Center together in time for the 9:00am keynote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those using COTA, the 18 Kenny/OSU line goes right by Tim Hortons, use stop 7084.&lt;/p&gt;
