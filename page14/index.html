Moreover, they’re quite good at manipulating text - the fundamental necessity for managing a Unix system.

<p>Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Haskell.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing the series on introductory Haskell programming we will talk
about abstractions common to everyday Haskell. This will include I/O and
you should be able to wrap your head around existing code. We didn’t make
it to the abstractions last week, so this week will be somewhat abstract.
Towards the end we should hopefully get something fairly practical
discussed.</p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it last week, we covered most* of the
material up to and including Chapter 8 of Learn You A
Haskell<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters</a>.
The topics in Chapter 8 will probably receive some attention again before
moving onto the other topics.</p>

<p>The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</p>

<p>There is also talk of doing some practical group projects. My suggestion is
going to be to work through some of the exercises in Learn You a Haskell or
Real World Haskell (free online books). If you are interested in this, we
will probably be organizing something like this during the meeting. If you
miss the meeting but would like to be involved, it will likely be a common
discussion topic in the OSC IRC channel.</p>

<p>Following up the craziness from last week’s Introduction to Haskell, I will
be presenting some more advanced stuff. I will begin by reviewing some of
the things from the end of last week’s talk for those who left early or
burned their brain out. I will show you some practical code using only the
tools we’ve learned so far and then some of the abstractions that Haskell
uses.</p>

<p>I’ve recently revamped my Haskell Presentation. It should flow
significantly smoother than its previous incarnations. This will be the
first of a series of Haskell talks. The series should cover a wide breadth
of material at a fairly deep level. This will be the basic introduction to
programming in Haskell.</p>

Daniel will go over the idea behind a DVCS, as well as some of the stuff going on under the hood in one of them (git).  Meisam will continue presenting on git, going over things such as the git commands, config file, hooks, and daemon.  Paul will present on Bazaar, another DVCS.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will plan out the topics for our meetings quarter. Bring ideas both for what you can present on, what you would like other people to present on, and topics for meetings which aren’t necessarily going to be structured as presentations.

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p>

<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.  When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>
