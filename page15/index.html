As is the general format, Alex will display and discuss major events in technology, with feedback from the audience. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (often abbreviated <strong>/.</strong>) is a nerd-oriented news website where the readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the front page, with a new page typically appearing every couple of hours. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then <a href="http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml">moderated</a> by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article. Alex’s discussion will attempt to mimic this format, and provoke civilized (yeah right!) discussion and debate about news topics that matter to nerds.</p>

Regular Expressions is a system for pattern recognition in text which is extremely useful for text processing. This talk may be especially appealing to up-and-coming *nix admins, since such systems rely heavily on text for things like configuration, but should be useful for anyone interested in software. The talk will mostly use examples with the grep and sed utilities, which are almost certainly already installed on your Linux or OSX laptops if you’re bringing one along. If you’re bringing a Windows laptop, grabbing Windows versions of such utilities (or Cygwin, or Linux in a VM) may be useful if you want to play along, but shouldn’t be required to benefit from the talk.</p>

Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost. Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it. Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others. Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim. Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I’m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is <em>just</em> as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. I also do not know the level of audience to expect, I don’t script or rehearse my presentations, and simply impressing you isn’t going to teach you anything. Therefore, the presentation shall be interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

He will be covering how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to try to protect your network. He will be demonstrating these attacks as well, and he encourages people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate (if your wireless card can not run the available software, he will be providing a sample dump for you to play around with, this will be available at the meeting). Everyone is encouraged to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.  Michael is am bringing my own equipment for demonstrative purposes and he encourage everyone to participate in the presentation.</p>
