Android is a Linux based, open source operating system, owned by Google, for phones and tablets. While key concepts of Android app development will be discussed, this presentation will be primarily focused on how the operating system works “under the hood” and the way that it leverages Linux for its security and stability.</p>

AWK is an interpreted programming language which excels at text processing and quick-and-dirty one-liners.  It is part of the POSIX standard and will thus be found on just about every unix system, including exceedingly minimal ones.  AWK has a number of relatively unique aspects that can make it quite enjoyable to use - for its target use, an AWK program is often significantly smaller than almost every other language.</p>

In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world. DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine. <strong>I reiterate, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</strong> In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>Every meeting, we mention something about our IRC channel. Some of you may not know what that means, so I wanted to clear everything up, as well as explain how to get chatting with us.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, which is a protocol for communication primarily for group discussion. It is a client-server model, meaning that clients connect to a server and that server tells the client what the other clients are saying. The protocol is also fairly old, originating from 1988.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started-with-weechat">Getting Started with WeeChat</h4>

<p>WeeChat is an extendable IRC client for GNU/Linux. It utilizes a terminal to render its interface, but is crisp and clean with how it presents information. To install, first get WeeChat from your distribution’s package manager. After installation, start weechat from the command line with</p>

<pre>$ weechat-curses</pre>

<p>and watch it fire up!</p>

<p>To get connected to freenode, type the following into weechat</p>

<pre>/connect irc.freenode.net</pre>

<p>You may need to set your name as other users see it, which can be done with</p>

<pre>/nick yourDesiredNick</pre>

<p>After you are fully connected to freenode, join any room you like with</p>

<pre>/join #osuosc</pre>

<h4 id="running-weechat-with-screen">Running WeeChat with screen</h4>

<p>To <strong>idle</strong> with WeeChat, that is, keep your chat session open without ever leaving, one utility that can be used is screen. To start, run:</p>

<pre>$ screen weechat-curses</pre>

<p>To detatch from this session, press control+a, then d. To reattach to this session, type</p>

<pre>$ screen -r</pre>

<p>Feel free to explore around freenode, and other IRC networks, as there are lots of interesting channels with different topics and projects behind them. I hope this has helped you!</p>

He will go over some of the benefits and limitations of each, and also compare configuration. Some command-line knowledge would be helpful, but no prior web server experience is needed. You will not necessarily walk out an expert on web servers, but by the end of the meeting, you should have the resources to set up a basic web server.</p>

This presentation/lecture is geared toward beginner users of the GNU/Linux OS, with an end goal of getting participants comfortable in a shell environment. Questions will be welcome at any time throughout the presentation as well.</p>

This meeting will consist of two different hour-long blocks. In the first section, we will provide installation media for different distributions of the GNU/Linux operating system, with seasoned members present to help get those interested installed. In the second hour, we will provide an introduction to the GNU/Linux command line environment.</p>

<p>Overall, we would like you to not only have GNU/Linux installed, but also have a pretty good idea of the things you can do with it.</p>

<p>Laptops are always encouraged, though not required, and as always, there will be pizza.</p>
