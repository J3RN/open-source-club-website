Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

<p>Ryan Karason will be teaching on open source hardware. The purpose of the lecture is to discuss the basic principles of electricity as applied to circuitry and to introduce the open hardware prototyping platform created by Arduino. If you are interested in getting involved in making your own circuits or better understanding others’ circuits so you can hack them, show up this Thursday; March 29, 1012 at 7PM in 266 Dreese Laboratory.</p>

<p>Thursday, March 8th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266 Joel Friedly will present on a project he was working on for a class.  For a lab in his Python class, he built a simple Bayes network-based text classifier to identify That’s What She Said jokes in conversation transcripts. This will be added to Jenni, the Open Source Club’s IRC bot, so that she can make jokes at appropriate times in conversation. It will replace the old TWSS identifier.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will plan for the next quarter.</p>

This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html">other proprietary and expensive image editors</a>, some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated.</p>

Many of Ohio State’s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.</p>

<p>Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called <a href="http://saml.xml.org/">SAML</a> that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called “federated identity”. The key benefit to users is the ability to leverage a password or other credentials shared with a trusted site (such as OSU’s login service) to access a variety of other sites without disclosing one’s password to them.</p>

<p>Scott Cantor, the administrator of the OSU web login environment, and a developer on the Shibboleth project for about 10 years, will discuss the project, the SAML standard and federated identity in general, and their future directions. OSU’s various activities in this area will also be discussed.</p>
