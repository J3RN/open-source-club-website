<p>Abstract:
DRM, spyware, adware, crippleware, backdoors.  What do all these have in common?  For starters, we usually prefer that they not be included in our software.  More specifically, we can say that these are all examples of anti-features.  Unfortunately, most ways people have tried to define ‘anti-feature’ have been inadequate in some way.  My first task, then, is to develop a clear, careful definition of an anti-feature. Next, I turn to the question of whether free and open-source software (FOSS) is compatible with anti-features.  The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes.  My third task is to explain why anti-features exist in the first place, and why it is usually a bad thing. In fact, it is often immoral for a programmer to implement an anti-feature.  Finally, I explain why FOSS can be a user’s best defense against anti-features.</p>

<p>As always, there will be pizza.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize the dangers of bureaucracy, as they can get
in the way of doing cool things. So long as the requirements of the Ohio
State University and the realistic needs of the club are met, efforts
should be made to minimize bureaucracy.</p>

<p>As the club has evolved it has become necessary to elect additional
officers in order to aid the further growth of the club. While this is
not an attempt to create a bureaucracy, it is necessary in order to
delegate duties among members in order to help the club run smoothly. At
the time of this writing there are currently three elected positions
within the club: President (or Benevolent Dictator), Vice President, and
Treasurer. These three positions will continue to exist as long as they
are required by the Ohio State University.</p>

<h1 id="article-i---name-purpose-and-non-discrimination-policy">Article I - Name, Purpose and Non-Discrimination Policy</h1>

<h2 id="section-1---name">Section 1 - Name</h2>

<p>This is the Open Source Club at the Ohio State University.</p>

<h2 id="section-2---purpose">Section 2 - Purpose</h2>

<p>Our purpose is to write and advocate free software, and to create a
community of excellent programmers. We advocate free software through
creation of documentation, providing support, and fighting cluelessness.</p>

<p>The club should take no “official” stand on political issues in debate
among the open source community, should adopt no “official club
license,” should not create strict guidelines for what kind of software
should be developed, should not create strict guidelines for how a
software project should be managed (including frequency of updates,
release models, code repository management, etc). Doing so would violate
the spirit of the Preamble. Individual software projects can be managed
however the individuals involved in the project see fit.</p>

<p>Implicit in this is that the club must allow advocacy of proprietary
software written for opensource platforms (for instance) or writing of
open source software for a proprietary platform (for instance) if some
of its members wish to do so. However, programs written by members of
the club, under the flag of the club, and distributed by the club should
meet some acceptable definition of open source software, defined by the
Open Source Initiative.</p>

<h2 id="section-3---non-discrimination-policy">Section 3 - Non Discrimination Policy</h2>

<p>In recognition of the importance of welcoming diversity for the sake of
creativity, and for the benefit of humanity, this club welcomes all
people. This means that our club and it’s members will not discriminate
against any individual(s) for reasons of age, color, disability, gender
identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, or veteran status.</p>

<h1 id="article-ii---membership-qualifications-and-categories-of-membership">Article II - Membership: Qualifications and categories of membership</h1>

<h2 id="part-1---membership-categories-and-selection-processes">Part 1 - Membership Categories and Selection Processes</h2>

<p>Ohio State University guidelines demand that voting membership be
limited to currently enrolled students. In order to meet this
requirement, membership will be divided into voting and non-voting
categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-voting membership can be obtained simply by attendance of
meetings or presence on our mailing list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voting membership requires that the individual meet all Ohio State
University guidelines for voting membership, and that the individual
has attended at least one meeting prior to the vote.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-2---membership-privileges">Part 2 - Membership Privileges</h2>

<p>Accounts on the club computers will be given out to any member who
requests an account, provided Ohio State University’s rules are
followed. These accounts may be revoked due to inactivity or failure to
follow the rules. Key card access to the club office will be granted
after a member has been active within the club for at least two months,
provided that Ohio State University rules are followed. Access may be
revoked due to inactivity or failure to follow the rules. When it is
necessary to take a vote, voting members are allowed to do so.</p>

<h2 id="part-3---membership-removal">Part 3 - Membership Removal</h2>

<p>Should cause for membership removal be raised, a member can be removed
in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A majority vote of club officers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A majority vote of voting members, providing at least there are at
least 3/4<sup>th</sup> of the usual number of attending voting
members present at the vote.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="article-iii---officer-positions-duties-selection-and-removal">Article III - Officer Positions, Duties, Selection, and Removal</h1>

<h2 id="part-1---officer-positions-duties-powers-and-limitations">Part 1 - Officer Positions, Duties, Powers and Limitations.</h2>

<p>There are three officer positions: The President (or Benevolent
Dictator), the Vice President, and the Treasurer. These three positions
will continue to exist as long as they are required by the Ohio State
University. The responsibilities of the aforementioned officers are as
follows:</p>

<p>The President shall have the following responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Managing key card access to the office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assignment of administrative accounts on the club computers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Securing the meeting location</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Announcing meeting location and topic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representing the club at other functions and in public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appointment of miscellaneous positions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Vice President shall have the following responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keeping the minutes of the meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carrying out the duties of the President when the President is
unable to do so</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Treasurer shall the following responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Produces and presents a semesterly budget</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchases pizza and other consumables for meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Represents our club at E-Council</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Produces and Submits applications for funding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these responsibilities may be delegated to other club members,
though they are ultimately the responsibility of the aforementioned
officers. The President will probably be the hardest working member of
the club, and therefore needs the power to make unilateral decisions for
the sake of saving time. No officer will necessarily have any control
over software projects, since by the definition of opensource software,
code forks can happen when they need to, and no one therefore has
ultimate power over a software project.</p>

<h2 id="part-2---officer-selection">Part 2 - Officer Selection</h2>

<p>Once a year, elections will take place for the officer positions. This
election must be announced at least one week prior to the vote. Any
voting member who meets The Ohio State University’s requirements may run
for any of the offices. The individual who receives the most votes will
attain that position for the next academic year, unless removed. Ties
will be broken by a vote of the officers in place before the active
election.</p>

<h2 id="part-3---officer-removal">Part 3 - Officer Removal</h2>

<p>Leadership is needed in any club and so officers are required to be
present at twelve out of fifteen official meetings per semester, while
it is also realized that extenuating circumstances are possible. In
order to eliminate doubts surrounding an officers excuse for missing a
meeting, said officer must notify at least one of the other officers
that they will not be in attendance at least 24 hours in advance. If an
officer is in violation of the aforementioned attendance rules, then the
club members will take a vote as to whether or not said officer will be
allowed to keep his or her position. For all other cases of misconduct,
the officer will face the same removal process as any other member of
the club.</p>

<h1 id="article-iv---advisor-qualification-criteria">Article IV - Advisor: Qualification Criteria</h1>

<p>The advisor should be a person of technical experience. Preferably
someone who has been involved in Opensource development. The advisor
must grow the goals of the club so that he or she does not get in their
way. The advisor exists to provide guidance, mentor-ship, and
cluefulness. The advisor’s term is one academic year.</p>

<p>University guidelines demand that the advisor (or failing that, the
sub-advisor) “of student organizations must be full-time members of the
University faculty or Administrative &amp; Professional staff.”</p>

<h1 id="article-v---meetings-of-the-organization">Article V - Meetings of the Organization</h1>

<p>It should be recognized that those involved in individual software
projects will have meetings separate from the meetings of rest of the
club. It is encouraged, however, that all club members be invited to
these meetings.</p>

<p>If none of the officers of the club can be in attendance at a given
meeting then said meeting will not take place, as decisions cannot be
made without the presiding officers. Members can still hold an
independent meeting, but it will not be recognized as an official club
meeting.</p>

<h1 id="article-vi---method-of-amending-constitution-proposals-notices-and-voting-requirements">Article VI - Method of Amending Constitution: Proposals, notices and voting requirements</h1>

<p>In the case that someone thinks that they need to alter the constitution
or by-laws (if any) for bug fixes, adding features, or compatibility
with new hardware, a quorum (3/4 of the voting membership) must vote and
the vote must be a 2/3 majority. Voting can be in person or via some
electronic medium provided that in either case a reasonable amount of
certainty of identity can be secured. Amendments and changes should be
taken advisedly and considered for a reasonable amount of time before
being implemented.</p>

<p>It is strictly discouraged that the constitution should be amended
frequently. If it is to be amended, and by-laws do not exist, this this
article (article VI) allows the creation of by-laws in favor of amending
the main body of the constitution (this document).</p>

<p>It is further strictly discouraged that any amendments or by-laws
restricting free commerce and creativity be created. New amendments or
by-laws should not conflict with the above stated purpose of the club.</p>

<h1 id="article-vii---method-of-dissolution-of-organization">Article VII - Method of Dissolution of Organization</h1>

<p>Should the club be forced to dissolve itself, any and all assets should
be put toward the club’s debt (if any). This includes university owned
equipment or university funds.</p>

<p>The remaining assets (hardware, operating funds, etc) should be donated
to a free software organization, like the fsf. The organization to which
the assets are donated must be determined at the time of dissolution by
the Benevolent Dictator, with approval of the supervisor.</p>
